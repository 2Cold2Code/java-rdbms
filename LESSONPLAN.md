### Introduction and Hook

Backend APIs let us access and manipulate data in endless ways. But. Where is the data we are accessing and manipulating. That data is stored in a database. The database can be accessed without using the API. By convention, we normally do not do that. However, at times it is necessary.

This module discusses what that database is and how to access it outside of the API! Much of the work in this module is done by DBAs (DataBase Administrators). However, to be considered a backend programmer, you are expected to know this material, especially how to query a database using SQL!

### Purpose

Create, query, and manipulate a system to persistently store our data, a database!

### Learning Activities

#### Working with the Objective: Explain what a Relational Database is and its core components

From the guided project discuss the table layout, create the database, and import that data

* [Check for Understanding CFU - Google Form](https://forms.gle/U3NWj7VKxPnm69gR8)

#### Working with the objective: Explain what SQL is and its advantages

Discuss what SQL is and give the basic forms of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE

#### Working with the objective: Query single table's data

Handle

* SQL Select
* SQL Where
* SELECT order by
* SQL Select Limit
* SQL Select Distinct
* SQL Min, Max (aggregate functions)
* SQL Count, Sum, Avg (aggregate functions)
* SQL And, Or, Not
* SQL Between
* SQL In
* SQL Like
* SQL is Null
* SQL Having
* SQL Alias

#### Working with the objective: Query multiple tables' data

* SQL Join
* SQL Left Join
* SQL Right Join
* SQL Full Join
* Skip rest of queries

* [Check for Understanding CFU - Google Form](https://forms.gle/4yE2QXy9qz7dtZfn8)

#### Working with the objective: Perform CRUD operations on an RDBMS using SQL

* SQL Insert
* SQL Update
* SQL Delete

#### Working with the objective: Explain data normalization and normal forms while normalizing data to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF)

Nothing to type, just walk the students through each step by expanding the headings 1NF, 2NF, 3NF

* Notice how we get more tables in each step
* Notice how in the end all data is stored only once. The rest is linked by system maintained ids

#### If Time Allows

##### Working with Objective: Open and query an existing database, or create a new one, while adding tables to a PostgreSQL database using the command line interface

* [Check for Understanding CFG = Google Form](https://forms.gle/4Q1YH2uZFsFjbpV2A)

##### Working with Objective: Open and query an existing database, or create a new one, while adding tables to a PostgreSQL database using the Graphic User Interface

#### Conclusion

##### Review what we just learned

* What persistent storage is - A DATABASE!
* How to access, query and manipulated, that database using SQL

##### How is this related to tomorrow's topic

* Tomorrow we start on a journey that shows how to interact with our database using Java Spring and REST APIs!
